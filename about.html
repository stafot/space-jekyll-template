<h2>About me...</h2>

<div class="aboutme">
    My professional experience extends in almost whole lifecycle of Operations and Development process (Systems and
    Networks Administration, Automation & Backup Solutions, Cloud infrastructure Designs & Setups, Logging Systems,
    Security Auditing…)
    <br/>I am almost obsessed with Systems visibility and clarity, but among all clouds I’ve ever dealt with the most
    interesting and valuable is my little daughter Nefeli. <br/>
    She is my main inspiration and gives me reasons to be better in all aspects of life...
